## PayPal REST API Sample for Node.js

Sample app using Paypal Rest APIs


### Configuration

Get your API credentials over at [developer.paypal.com](http://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/myapps) by creating a new application. Use these credentials in the [config.json](../master/config.json) file.

The app uses standard PayPal test credentials at this very moment.

### Running it

First of all install all needed packages using `npm install`. Then run the app by using `node app.js`.
